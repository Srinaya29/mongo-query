//Aggregation framework..............................................................................................
//The Aggregation Framework in MongoDB is a powerful tool for processing and transforming data in a collection
//to produce summarized or computed results. It works like a pipeline, where data passes through stages
//(like filtering, grouping, or sorting) to generate insights, such as totals, averages, or grouped data.

    {}, //pipeline 2
